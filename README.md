# IteraX

**IteraX** is a web application designed to solve numerical methods interactively.  

It is composed of two parts: **Frontend** (React) and **Backend** (Python - FastAPI).

---

## ðŸ§  About the Methods

The backend provides six numerical methods for finding the roots of a function:

- **Bisection Method**
- **False Position Method (Regula-Falsi)**
- **Newton-Raphson Method**
- **Secant Method**
- **Fixed Point Iteration**
- **Multiple Roots Method**

Each method iteratively finds approximations for the roots of mathematical functions based on user inputs.

## ðŸš€ Running the Application Remotely

### Backend Setup (Python - FastAPI)

1. **Clone the repository** and navigate to the backend directory.
   
2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate # On Windows
   source venv/bin/activate # On Mac/Linux
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Start the backend server:**

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

The backend will be running at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

---

### Frontend Setup (React)

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory.**

2. **Install the required libraries:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the frontend server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The frontend will be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
